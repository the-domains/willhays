# Cool Sunglasses, not so cool AI design

So far very underwhelmed with the robot design. I guess this is both good and bad. I was hoping to use this which would elevate some design time on my end- however not sure it's going to be up to par enough to suit my needs. One thing is for sure. At least my poor writing skills match the poor design skills of the robot.. so that's working out.
